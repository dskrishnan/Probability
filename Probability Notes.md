##### Probabilistic Model
* It is a quantitative description of a situation or Phenomenon or experiment whose outcome is uncertain.

##### How to build a Probabilistic Model?.
* By Specifying the possible outcomes of the experiment
    * Define Sample space
    * Specify a probability law which assigns probabilities to outcomes or collection of outcomes.  
      -  The Probability Law tells us that whether an outcome is much more likely than some other outcome.

##### Axioms of Probability
* Probabilities has to satisfy certain basic properties in order to be meaningful. These properties are called Axioms of Probability Theory.
* For example, Probabilities cannot be negative.

##### Types of Probabilistic Model
* Discrete - This is relatively easy to build & understand.
* Continuous - This is bit more complex to build & understand.

##### Sample Space:
Putting together a Probabilistic Model i.e. a model of random experiment or random Phenomenon requires two steps.  
* Describe the possible outcomes of the phenomenon or experiment of interest.
* Describe our beliefs about the likelihood of the outcomes by specifying a probability law.

###### Describe possible outcomes
* List (set) of possible outcomes \Omega
